i've tried to start a blog a few timesbut never really got into it. reasons for
previous failures varies, but it's usually me overthinking it, spending too much
time either looking for the perfect setup/framework to use, or trying to
vertically-align something on the page with css, or only publishing when i have
complete, well-thought-out, deep content to share.

so this time around i'm goign to try something different.

no fancy setup: this is a static website built with
[zola](https://www.getzola.org/), with a basic
[theme](https://www.getzola.org/themes/no-style-please/) that mostly works.

for comments, i'm using [giscus](https://giscus.app/), a github discussion-based
comment/reaction system; it requires commenters to have a github account, but
since i'll be posting mostly on engineering topics, it's probably fine.

my hopes is that i use this space to record notes and things i learn, write down
some longer thoughts (read rants) on pertinent topics, and share a thing or two
about what i'm currently working on.

i will probably also write about running, which is the other thing i do.
